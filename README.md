# Voice Chatbots for Visually Impaired Education

## Overview

This repository explores the use of voice chatbots to enhance education and communication experiences for visually impaired children. It primarily focuses on leveraging technologies of Microsoft Azure AI capabilities to develop specialized voice chatbots. The report contained in this repository analyzes the potential of these chatbots to alleviate the difficulties faced by visually impaired students in traditional schooling.

## Contents

This repository contains different implementations in Python and .NET for building voice chatbots targeting visually impaired education. It encompasses the following:

- **Python Implementation:** Includes code and resources for creating voice chatbots using Python, particularly focusing on Amazon Alexa's capabilities.
  
- **.NET Implementation:** Provides code and resources for building voice chatbots using .NET framework, specifically leveraging Microsoft Azure AI services such as Language Studio and Speech Services.

## Report Highlights

The included [report](./voicebot-report.pdf) delves into:

- Benefits and drawbacks of using Amazon Alexa for this purpose.
- Advantages of Microsoft Azure AI services, specifically Language Studio and Speech Services.
- Ideas for further research and real-world testing to create an inclusive educational resource for visually impaired children.
- Utilization of Raspberry Pi as an interface and ensuring code compatibility for this platform.
